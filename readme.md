# Create a To Do List Playground

**Description:**

The "Create a To Do List Playground" was built to enhance and strengthen a Web Dev Student's freshly acquired skills in VanillaJS. 

I've built and used this "Create a To Do List Playground" which enhanced my skills in VanillaJS especially in Variables and Datatypes, Arrays and Objects, Functions, Logic Control Flow, Iterations, DOM and Event Listeners.

If you are new in Web Development and learning VanillaJS, feel free to use this Playground too, so you can also level up your skills to greater heights!

Wishing you the all the best!
